The page that you are trying to view is not found on the server..

<p> hey! user, if you think this is an error, please contact me on github @abhinav-cmd, I'll be happy to help! go to the <a href={{url_for("home")}}> home page</a> ðŸ˜ƒ
  </p>
<!-- in place of {{url_for('home')}} we could've written just a single '/' but jinja has this functionality of explicitly stating the page you want to go to, so why not use it!-->
